# Securing-Computing-Environments-against-Cryptojacking-Attack-Rohan_Sharma


The main goal of this research project is to detect "Cryptomining Malware" using machine learning. Attackers constantly come up with new strategies to exploit mining systems as cryptocurrency's popularity increases, leading to an increase in illicit mining activity. This vectorised cyber attack is called Cryptojacking, in the recent past this has gained popularity. In order to build a comprehensive model that improves our capacity to precisely anticipate the presence of cryptomining malware, we used a different datasets in our study.
